# Texturesynthesis Practical (Summer term 2015, University of Mainz)

This practical was about implementing algorithms of texture synthesis using a language of choice. We used Dart for implementing those algorithms.

## Based on following algorithms

* ["Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling"](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-iccv99.pdf) by Alexei A. Efros and Thomas K. Leung
* ["Fast Texture Synthesis using Tree-structured Vector Quantization"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/texture.pdf) by Li-Yi Wei and Marc Levoy
* ["Texture Optimization for Example-based Synthesis"](http://physbam.stanford.edu/~kwatra//publications/TO/TO-final.pdf) by Vivek Kwatra, Irfan Essa, Aaron Bobick and Nipun Kwatra

## Examples

### Non parametric sampling

#### Single resolution

| Input image   | Output (patchsize 10x10)           | Cool  |
| ------------- |---------------| ------|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
